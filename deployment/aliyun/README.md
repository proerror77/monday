# Aliyun Binance data host

The Tokyo ECS runs two public-market-data services. Neither service submits orders.

```bash
systemctl status binance-lob-archiver@spot.service
systemctl status binance-lob-archiver@usdm.service
journalctl -u 'binance-lob-archiver@*' -f
```

Each service opens bounded WebSocket shards, records every diff, fetches a REST
Top-100 snapshot, validates sequence continuity, writes replay checkpoints, compresses
hourly segments, and uploads `.jsonl.zst`, `manifest.json`, and `_SUCCESS` to OSS.
`health.json` under `/data/monday/spool/binance-lob/<market>/` reports freshness,
symbol coverage, bridge state, gap count, free disk space, and whether the 20GiB
warning threshold is active. It also reports pending upload count, last upload
success/error, and an upload warning so OSS failures cannot look fully healthy.
A silent WebSocket shard fails after
`STALL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`; systemd then restarts the service. Low disk space emits a
warning but does not pause collection. Successfully uploaded segments are deleted
from the local spool immediately. Pending segments are retained when OSS upload
fails so the collector never creates a silent data hole merely to reclaim space.
The shared pending-diff budget still bounds initialization bursts. Services restart
every six hours to refresh the active-symbol catalog.

Current coverage:

- `spot`: every active Binance spot symbol; `TRD_GRP_261` symbols are tagged as
  tokenized securities in manifests.
- `usdm`: every active Binance USD-M perpetual contract.

The July 13 full-market probe measured about 1,450 events/s and 0.46MiB/s on the
wire. With both production services synchronized, the host used about 1.2 CPU
cores and less than 1GiB of service memory. The 80% CPU quota and 3.2GiB memory
limit on each service preserve host headroom during bursts.

## Backtesting storage boundary

Use OSS raw segments as the immutable source of truth, not as the repeated query
format. Validate `_SUCCESS`, SHA-256, snapshots, and sequence-gap status, then
materialize selected partitions as Parquet. A research host caches those Parquet
files locally and uses DuckDB for filtering, joins, feature datasets, run lineage,
and result metadata. The Rust `apps/replay` / `apps/backtest` path owns order-book
replay, fees, latency, slippage, fills, and capacity simulation.

This is a deterministic replay contract for the state captured from a Top-100
snapshot seed plus sequence-checked diffs; it is not a complete venue-depth
contract. Deep unchanged levels can move into the visible range after enough
near-book deletions without appearing in a diff, so manifests explicitly set
`venue_depth_complete=false`. Top-20/Top-50 imbalance research must validate the
acceptable snapshot age and churn window for each experiment. Strategies that
require guaranteed depth completeness or market-impact modeling need a separately
benchmarked deeper or periodically refreshed snapshot dataset.

ClickHouse is optional for always-on shared analytics, dashboards, and derived
realtime features. It is not required for the first backtest pipeline and should
not duplicate the complete raw OSS tape.
